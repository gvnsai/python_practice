Task 1 – Access the workbooks and create a database

Create a Python script (db_create.py) to perform the following tasks:
• Open the excel files.
• Create a PSQL database with two tables, one for each excel file. Each column in the excel files
should correspond to a column in the tables. Make sensible decisions for attribute types.
• Import the data from the excel files to the corresponding tables in the database.
